# Overview

## 🌻&nbsp; What is Sunflower

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunflower is a library based on antd and react-hooks, it provides common business processes through hooks. In addition, sunflower provides a more convenient way to combine this process with antd ui components.

## 🎩&nbsp; Features

- 🏄  Easy to use. You don't need to know too much about state and change methods to use components with interaction logic.
- 💅 Easy to customize. You can easily customize the combination of components you need.
- 👯 Layered design. You can use react-hooks without ui or react-hooks with antd.
- 🤾‍♂️Hooks return HOC. Crazy, but it does give you a more convenient api. At the same time you can choose not to use.

## 🤔&nbsp; Why?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, we use multiple component components of antd, and we organize their relationship through state and props methods like `value`, `onChange`.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a way to reduce the process code and describe the relationship between multiple ui components? How can we use a way to precipitate existing processes?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes,we can use react-hooks, so the relationship between multiple antd components will be in react-hooks.Further, we use hoc as the api, so we don't have to care about the state and methods.

## 📟&nbsp; Usage

```
$ npm install sunflower-antd --save
```

```jsx
import { useFormTable } from 'sunflower-antd';

function Component(props) {
  const { Form, Table } = useFormTable(config);
  return <div>
    <Form />
    <Table />
  </div>;
}

ReactDOM.render(<Component />, mountNode);
```
